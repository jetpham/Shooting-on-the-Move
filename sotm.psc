//        (Easy) Assuming you have a vision of the target, you should be able to calculate your distance to it, which
//        would allow you to have the shooter spin at the appropriate speed to land into the target.
//
//        (Hard) if you know how fast the robot is moving and in which direction it is moving in and your target is
//        stationary, you can break the movement of the robot into component vectors relative to your target. from there,
//        you need to relate the speeds of the component vectors to make your turret spin faster/slower to keep on target.
//        To make this easier, assume 0 (or very little) acceleration.
//
//        (hard) In order to get an accurate reading of the target for both points 1 and 2, you need some sort of latency
//        compensation for the camera, as it gives you data at a much slower rate than any of your other sensors. Failure
//        to take this into account will throw off all your calculations for points 1 and 2. this isnâ€™t necessary if you
//        simulate the robot to get a work of concept, but it does become an issue in the real world. I believe the
//        solution for this is to use a Kalman/extended Kalman filter, which I understand what they do at a high level,
//        but to implement it will require us to look at other teams
